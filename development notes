development notes::
worked on team class draft first
then worked on adding and removing teams from combo box
then worked on the is guest checkbox


working on making it change to the state of the teams is_guest boolean

finished fixing is_guest and have added failsafes to catch index out of range

i have finished the team tab :)




ive now added functionality to the selctedgamecombo box and allow it to set the game type to our teams event
ive been working on the scoreboard and sycronizing the team names and hopefully the data between them. im pllanning to instead of setting up only 6 teams ill use a arraylsit and push one when i need to

ive reworked how i do teams and have now put them into a arraylist, this means when i remove temas the class instance is actually removed from the array, and no longer accsessible by the program


update on the issues:
i had a issue with adding and removing teams from the event table so what i did was add and remove rows according to the amount of teams.


//04/11/2020:
im working on fixing the issue of when you click events it will throw errors.
right so here is the issue:
the issue is that when you change what event your on it will check o see what that events game type is.
yet the game type is only set when selected .
so when you goto a new event. it hasnt been initilized so it throws a error.

///update!
i fixed the issue by chnaging my teamarray setup to automatically initilize the events as notset. this stops the issue of initilization.
ive also syncronized the selctedgamecombobox to the events variable causing it to just be more nicer and easier to use



//another update
ive also now intergrated github.
this is kinda my first time using it in the sense of me pushing it online






//09/11/2020
im working on how to give data to my event class and pass user input
also working on seting table data to equal event data also

its was a very simple job to implement data since only one colums is able to be edited , but at the time i forgot this and over complicated my work


//10/11/2020

im adding the option to define all players inside of the team and am reworking the team tab to fit this.
i may change it to a popup in the near future.


//11/11/2020
ive fixed a issue with the guest checkbox due to it being not in the right place and im adding functionality to player list


//16/11/2020
im now working on the players for each team since ive got issues with how ive implemented it.

//17/11/2020
i have implemented teams to allow seperate players and have also fixed a few bugs. look at github to see.
